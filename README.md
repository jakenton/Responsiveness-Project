# Responsiveness Project
A high-fidelity, fully responsive website built as a FrontendPractice challenge to sharpen my HTML & CSS skills through recreating a live site with pixel-perfect accuracy.

## Project Overview
This repository contains my attempt to replicate a real-world website using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques (grid, flexbox, media queries, etc.) to ensure the design adapts seamlessly across devices.

## Features
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Modular, maintainable CSS with responsive breakpoints
- Fluid layouts that adjust from mobile to desktop
- Consistent typography, spacing, and color treatment
- Organized file structure for readability and future enhancement

## Purpose & Learning Goals
- Practice turning a visual design into working markup and style
- Deepen understanding of responsive design fundamentals
- Learn to manage CSS for multiple viewport sizes
- Build confidence in translating static designs into real web pages
